                        <h4>Is forex trading risky?</h4>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Forex trading involves significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The foreign exchange market is volatile, and prices can move rapidly, resulting in substantial losses. At Ghostly Traders, we emphasize risk management and never guarantee profits. We recommend only trading capital you can afford to lose.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No. We do not guarantee profits under any circumstances. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The forex market is unpredictable, and losses are always possible. Our focus is on teaching disciplined trading strategies and risk management, but individual results will vary.</p>

                        <p>We support both MetaTrader 4 (MT4) and MetaTrader 5 (MT5). Both platforms are industry-standard tools for forex trading and offer excellent charting, analysis tools, and automated trading capabilities. You can choose the platform that best fits your trading style.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The minimum starting capital depends on the service you're interested in. For trading signals, you can start with most brokers' minimum accounts (often $100-$500). For account management services, we have higher minimums for professional management. Contact us for specific details about your chosen service.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Signal frequency varies based on market conditions. We prioritize quality over quantity and only send setups that meet our strict criteria. During volatile markets, you may receive multiple signals; during quiet periods, signals may be less frequent. We never force trades just to appear active.</p>

                        <p>Yes. We offer comprehensive education for traders of all levels, including complete beginners. Our courses cover forex basics, market mechanics, technical analysis, risk management, and trading psychology. We believe that educated traders make better decisions.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Risk management is our top priority. We risk 1-2% of account capital per trade, always use stop-losses, avoid over-leveraging, and never use dangerous strategies like martingale. Every trade is planned with a clear risk-to-reward ratio before entry. Capital preservation comes first.</p>
